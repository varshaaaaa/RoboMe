# RoboMe

RoboMe is a Portable Medical Assistant!

RoboMe can be used to transport items from a starting location to another, such as helping carry medicine in a hospital or at home.

# The Code
BUTTONSANDLINE is the final code for line sensing, manual control, and buzzer for object detection.

The different parts of the code are based on https://www.hackster.io/jason_rubadue/ti-rslk-build-workshop-instructions-ff82b7#code!

roboMeButtons contains code for manual control of the robot.

This project involves a 4 button RF remote and receiver, as well as the TI RSLK Max Robot and a buzzer.
BUTTONSANDLINE is the code that programs the robot to follow a line when A is pressed on the remote. 
The other buttons are for manual control: B makes the robot turn towards the right, C moves the robot forward, and D moves it backwards.
The buzzer sounds when an object is detected by the bump sensors!
